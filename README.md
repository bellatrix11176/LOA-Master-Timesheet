# LOA Time Tracker (Excel)

This repository contains an Excel-based LOA (Leave of Absence) time tracking sheet designed to help track **frequency** (monthly hours available/used) and **duration** (time entries for specific days).

## What’s Included
- **Protected Excel tracker** to prevent accidental deletion of important cells, formulas, and structure  
- **Editable entry fields** for daily LOA tracking  
- **Dropdown selections** (ex: Paid vs. Unpaid) to keep entries consistent  
- **Auto-generated IDs / formatted fields** where applicable

## How to Use
1. Download/open the Excel file.
2. Only edit the **unlocked** cells (these are the intended input fields).
3. Use dropdowns when provided (do not type over them).
4. Enter time in this format: `5:30 PM` (or use the dropdown/time picker if enabled).
5. If a field asks for follow-ups:
   - Enter scheduled follow-ups with time + brief details, **or**
   - If none, type: **All follow-ups complete.**

## Notes
- This sheet is meant for **personal tracking** and organization.
- Protection is enabled to keep formulas and key cells from being changed.
